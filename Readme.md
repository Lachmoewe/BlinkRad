# BlinkRad

Using old or broken bicycle rims as an ilumination project.

36 boards, 36 rgb-LEDs, 36 attiny13, 108 FETs, 108 resistors 
(at least if youve got 36 spoke rims).
1 controller of your choice.

## Current Status

I got some prototype boards at home, now its time to write some code.
Right now they seem to work, LED blinks as the FETs catch charge from
the air.

## Further plans
- network control with teensy3.1
- develop a protocol to send to attinys
- maybe 433MHz control
- you name it!
